###Front-End Streams

This is a series of front-end stream examples. The first three exampls were developed by [jessekeane](http://words.jessekeane.me/about/) in his front-end stream [post](http://words.jessekeane.me/front-end-streams/). I've created solutions for them here because the post did not originally have solutions. Some of the tests in `test/index.js` give a sense for how to reason about the dependencies for libs like [dom-delegation-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-delegation-stream). Much thanks to [jessekeane](http://words.jessekeane.me/about/) for exposing these modules to me.

###Getting Started

Assuming you have `node` and `npm` installed:

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm run-script build # to build example JS

$ npm test # to run the tests
```

###ToDo

0. create gh-pages branch

1. more examples

2. more tests

3. hook up TravisCI
