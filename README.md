###Front-End Streams

These are a series of front-end stream examples. Examples one through three were first developed and mentioned by [jessekeane](http://words.jessekeane.me/about/) in his [post](http://words.jessekeane.me/front-end-streams/). I've created solutions for them here because the post did not originally have solutions. Some of the tests in `test/index.js` reflect how to reason about the dependencies for libs such as [dom-delegation-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-delegation-stream). The `package.json` file also grabs all dependency modules so more tests on the submodules can be written. Much thanks to [jessekeane](http://words.jessekeane.me/about/) for exposing these modules to me.
